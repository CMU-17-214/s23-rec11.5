# Design Fixes

In each subsection, provide a short answer, typically not longer than a few bullet points or sentences, addressing all parts of the question indicated in square brackets. Where appropriate point to specific files/classes/methods and *use the design terminology* from the lecture (referring to specific design goals/principles/heuristics/patterns).
 
We ask for exactly one instance of a problem. The code often has more problems, so you may chose which ones you describe.

Also, your discussions may overlap in that you may have addressed several design problems with the same change. This is okay if a change indeed relates to multiple design issues or questions. However, keep in mind that you must make **at least 4** unique refactorings overall. 



## SubSubSubSubSubArticles

The way nested articles are represented in the implementation is problematic. Briefly describe why it is problematic and how you fixed it:



[why a problem]



[how fixed] 



## Responsibility Assignment

Describe a problem with responsibility assignment where fields or methods were in inappropriate places, why this was problematic, and how you fixed it:



[problem] [location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Code Duplication

Describe an instance of duplicate code that could be abstracted and reused using methods, inheritance, delegation, or design patterns and how you fixed it:



[problem] [location] [how fixed]



## Coupling

Describe an instance of unnecessary coupling, describe why this coupling is bad, and how you fixed it:



[problem] [location] [why a problem] [how fixed]




## Cohesion

Describe an instance of objects, classes, or methods that severely violate cohesion (e.g., god class). Describe what concerns are mixed and how you fixed it:



[location] [concerns] [how fixed]



## Extensibility

Describe an aspect of the implementation that is unnecessarily difficult to extend (i.e., require modifications of existing methods, possibly in multiple places) and how you improved it:



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Encapsulation

Describe an instance where an object/class violates encapsulation principles. Describe why it is problematic and how you fixed it:



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Instanceof

The use of `instanceof` is often an indication of a design problem. Provide an example of a method that uses `instanceof`, discuss why this use is problematic, and how you fixed it.



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Events (Challenge Problem)

If you want to claim bonus points for implementing events, briefly describe your design and how you ensure that you can nest events in articles and vice versa:
